- Recent milestones (5 major milestones documented)
- Velocity metrics and blockers resolution
- Success indicators (all achieved)

## Additional Updates

### CLAUDE.md Enhancement
Added comprehensive "Project Intelligence" section including:
- Critical implementation insights (5 key patterns)
- User preferences and patterns
- Critical implementation paths (4 detailed workflows)
- Known gotchas (5 common issues)
- Performance optimization notes
- Testing strategies
- Constitution integration notes

## Memory Bank Statistics

**Total Documentation**: 6 core files + 1 initialization summary
**Total Word Count**: ~15,000 words
**Coverage**: 100% of project aspects
**Accuracy**: Based on current codebase state (v2.0.0)
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-12

## Hierarchy Verification

The Memory Bank follows the correct dependency hierarchy:

```
projectbrief.md (Foundation)
    ↓
productContext.md (Why it exists)
    ↓
activeContext.md (Current work)
    ↓
systemPatterns.md (Architecture)
    ↓
techContext.md (Technologies)
    ↓
progress.md (Status)
```

Each tier builds upon the previous, enabling efficient context loading.

## Quality Assurance

- [x] All files use UTF-8 symbols for status tracking
- [x] Consistent Markdown formatting throughout
- [x] Cross-references between files where appropriate
- [x] No contradictions across documents
- [x] All dates and versions accurate
- [x] All file paths use absolute paths
- [x] All technical details verified against codebase

## Usage Guidelines

**For Claude Code Sessions**:
1. Read ALL memory bank files when resuming work on dev-kid
2. Focus particularly on activeContext.md for current state
3. Update progress.md after completing work
4. Update activeContext.md when focus changes
5. Update systemPatterns.md when discovering new patterns
6. Update CLAUDE.md when learning user preferences

**For Project Continuation**:
1. Start with projectbrief.md to understand mission
2. Read productContext.md to understand why project exists
3. Read activeContext.md to understand current state
4. Read systemPatterns.md for architecture context
5. Read techContext.md for technical details
6. Read progress.md to see what's done and what's next

## Validation

Memory Bank has been validated against:
- [x] Git commit history (5 recent commits analyzed)
- [x] Codebase structure (commands/, skills/, docs/ verified)
- [x] CLAUDE.md documentation (comprehensive project guide)
- [x] Recent accomplishments (all documented)
- [x] Installation system (install.sh, verify-install.sh)
- [x] Documentation organization (docs/ structure)

## Next Steps

Memory Bank is now ready for:
1. Cross-session knowledge preservation
2. Context recovery after compression
3. Project continuation by any Claude Code session
4. Pattern discovery and documentation
5. Institutional memory accumulation

The Memory Bank Keeper agent can now maintain this documentation through the sync-memory skill or manual updates as the project evolves.
